# RiscVSim

Simple RISC-V simulator that reads and simulates assembly code directly, without other toolchains

https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim SPIKE but it requires full compiler toolchain, it simulates from binary, not assembly

https://ascslab.org/research/briscv/simulator/simulator.html looks like a nice online assembly simulator

https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes QT based C++ but also online; looks like it might simulate assembly
